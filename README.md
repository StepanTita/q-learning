# Q-Learning game with epsilon-greedy algorithm üéÆ üß†

This is a university project.
The game with basic level editing. One can add obstacles, enemies, and bonuses on the level by putting those in the JSON file. That way creating and editing test environments is as easy as adding a couple of rows to the JSON file. After the level is built, one should initialize some basic parameters and see the model performance. Based on that, one may consider updating or keeping the parameters. The game itself is just a set of primitives. The objects can either be static or moving.
We also introduce the concept of **reward backpropagation** in this project. 

More precise description of the solution and full report please find in the [REPORT](report.pdf)

## Features üöÄ
- **Q-Learning Powered**: Experience a game environment influenced by Q-Learning.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**: Watch the game evolve and adapt its strategy over time.
- **Custom Levels**: Design and play on your very own levels using straightforward JSON structures:

_*.json level file_
```json
{
  "floors": [
    {
      "shape": "rect",
      "type": "platform",
      "x": 0,
      "y": 650,
      "width": 150,
      "height": 10
    }
  ],
  "walls": [
    {
      "shape": "rect",

      "width": 10,
      "height": 300
    }
